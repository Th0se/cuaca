Sure! Here's an explanation of every key in the JSON object:

"coord": An object containing latitude and longitude coordinates of the location, with keys "lon" and "lat".
"weather": An array containing one or more objects representing current weather conditions. Each object has several properties, including an "id" number, a general "main" weather category (e.g. "Clouds"), a longer "description" of the weather conditions (e.g. "overcast clouds"), and an "icon" code that represents the weather graphically.
"base": A string indicating the type of data that was used as the source for the weather information.
"main": An object containing various measurements of the current weather, including "temp" (temperature in Kelvin), "feels_like" (apparent temperature in Kelvin), "temp_min" (minimum temperature in Kelvin), "temp_max" (maximum temperature in Kelvin), "pressure" (atmospheric pressure in hPa), "humidity" (relative humidity as a percentage), "sea_level" (atmospheric pressure on sea level in hPa), and "grnd_level" (atmospheric pressure on ground level in hPa).
"visibility": The visibility distance in meters.
"wind": An object containing details about wind speed and direction, with keys "speed" (wind speed in meters per second), "deg" (wind direction in degrees), and "gust" (wind gust speed in meters per second).
"clouds": An object containing information about cloud coverage, with key "all" indicating the percentage of sky covered by clouds.
"dt": A Unix timestamp representing the time of the weather report.
"sys": An object containing information about the location and time zone of the report, with keys "country" (a two-letter country code), "sunrise" (a Unix timestamp representing the time of sunrise), "sunset" (a Unix timestamp representing the time of sunset).
"timezone": The time zone offset from UTC in seconds.
"id": The ID of the city for which the weather report was generated.
"name": The name of the city for which the weather report was generated.
"cod": The HTTP status code of the response, where 200 indicates success.
